*Read the entire assignment before starting.*

## Assignment

Write a report that contains the answers and *explains how you arrived at the answers* to the following questions. Before starting, review the [HW report guidelines](https://github.com/odu-cs432-websci/public/blob/main/fall21/getting-started/reports.md).  Name your report for this assignment `HW1-report` with the proper file extension.  Do not edit this file (`README.md`).

### Q1
Consider the "bow-tie" structure of the web in the Broder et al. paper ["Graph Structure in the Web"](http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/broder00bowtie.pdf) that was described in Module 1. 

Now consider the following links:

```text
A --> B
B --> C
B --> D
C --> A
C --> E
E --> C
E --> G
F --> E
H --> G
I --> A
I --> M
I --> N
J --> K
L --> D
M --> D
```

Draw the resulting [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph) (either sketch on paper or use another tool) showing how the nodes are connected to each other and include an image in your report.  This does not need to fit into the bow-tie type diagram, but should look more similar to the graph on slide 24 from [Module-01 Web-Science-Architecture](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/178GkNtFAPB5fzs1D-wdCnlOdbcTyhpAIz_wKxVUaHVk/edit#slide=id.ga9773ac230_0_799).

For the graph, list the nodes (in alphabetical order) that are each of the following categories:
* SCC: 
* IN: 
* OUT: 
* Tendrils: 
    * indicate if the tendril is reachable from IN or can reach OUT
* Tubes: 
    * explain how the nodes serve as tubes
* Disconnected:
    
    
### Q2
Demonstrate that you know how to use `curl` and are familiar with the available options.

URI to request: http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/courses/cs532/ua_echo.php

a) First, load the URI directly in your browser and take a screenshot.  The resulting webpage should show the "User-Agent" HTTP request header that your web browser sends to the web server.

b) In a single `curl` command, request the URI, show the HTTP response headers, follow any redirects, and change the User-Agent HTTP request field to "CS432/532".  Show command you used and the result of your execution on the command line.  (Either take a screenshot of your terminal or copy/paste into a code segment.)

c) In a single `curl` command, request the URI, follow any redirects, change the User-Agent HTTP request field to "CS432/532", and save the HTML output to a file.  Show the command you used and the result of your execution on the command line. View the HTML output file that was produced by `curl` in a web browser and take a screenshot.

Explain the results you get for each of these steps.


### Q3
Write a Python program to find links to PDFs in a webpage.

Your program must do the following:
* take the URI of a webpage as a command-line argument
* extract all the links from the page
* for each link, request the URI and use the `Content-Type` HTTP response header to determine if the link references a PDF file 
* for all links that reference a PDF file, print the original URI (found in the source of the original HTML), the final URI (after any redirects), and the number of bytes in the PDF file. (Hint: `Content-Length` HTTP response header)

Here is a snippet of the expected operation:

```
% python3 findPDFs.py https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/courses/cs532/pdfs.html

URI: http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/pubs/ht-2018/hypertext-2018-nwala-bootstrapping.pdf
Final URI: https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/pubs/ht-2018/hypertext-2018-nwala-bootstrapping.pdf
Content Length: 994,153 bytes

URI: http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/pubs/ipres-2018/ipres-2018-atkins-news-similarity.pdf
Final URI: https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/pubs/ipres-2018/ipres-2018-atkins-news-similarity.pdf
Content Length: 18,995,885 bytes
```

Show that the program works on 3 different URIs, one of which must be https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/courses/cs532/pdfs.html, which contains 8 links to PDFs. 
* Many faculty members have a list of their publications in PDF form on their webpages.  You can discover ODU CS faculty webpages is through the [Research](https://odu.edu/compsci/research) page on the CS homepage. Click on a faculty member's name and that will take you to their ODU directory page.  Most of us have another link on that page that goes to our homepages where you can then find a list of publications that will often link to PDFs. 
* Also, there are a set of pages linked on our [CS 432/532 Syllabus](https://github.com/odu-cs432-websci/public/blob/main/fall21/syllabus.md) that say "pdf available".  If you follow some of those links, you'll likely find a page that links to at least one PDF.

You will likely want to use the BeautifulSoup Python library for this question. On the ODU-CS Linux machines, you may need to run ``pip3 install beautifulsoup4`` before you can use BeautifulSoup, but you don't need root privileges to do this.

## Submission

Make sure that you have committed and pushed your local repo to GitHub.  Your repo should include your report, images, and any code you developed to answer the questions.  Include "Ready to grade @weiglemc @pscheibl" in your final commit message. 

Submit the URL of your *report* in Blackboard:

* Click on HW1 under Assignments in Blackboard
* Under "Assignment Submission", click the "Write Submission" button.
* Copy/paste the URL of your report into the edit box
  * should be something like https<nolink>://github.com/odu-cs432-websci/fall21-hw1-*username*/blob/master/HW1-report.{pdf,md}
* Make sure to "Submit" your assignment.
